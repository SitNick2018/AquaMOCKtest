# AquaMOCKtest

two files added that includes a solution for the task:

1.clientInterface.py
2.tests.py


Both of them tested and can be run after copy to the same directory with server.py
Interface to the server implemented in clientInterface.py
Created 8 tests in order to demonstrate how it works.
