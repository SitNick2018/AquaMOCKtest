# AquaMOCKtest

two files added that includes a solution for the task:

1.clientInterface.py

Both of them tested and can be run after copy to the same directory with server.py
Interface to the server implemented in clientInterface.py
Created 8 tests in order to demonstrate how it works.

Additional archive file AquaMOCKtest.tar.gz
added here AS IS - this is working directory
unpack
server start:
export FLASK_APP=server.py
PYTHONPATH=. flask run
run tests.py with python tests.py
